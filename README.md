# SyncSchedule
SyncSchedule is a role‑based academic timetable management system developed using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
The system helps institutions generate and manage semester‑wise and batch‑wise timetables while ensuring conflict‑free scheduling for faculty, rooms, and classes.

The application provides separate dashboards for Admin, Head of Department (HOD), and Faculty, allowing administrators to manage users, subjects, rooms, and assignments, while faculty can view personalized teaching schedules.

The goal of SyncSchedule is to reduce manual effort, minimize scheduling errors, and improve overall timetable efficiency in academic institutions.
